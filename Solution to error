If arises about file pls change the file locations of 
        1. Passwords.txt
        2. welcome.txt
to your desired file location 
IT may or maynot arise depending on your OS configurations 

Also
"----- timeout feature is not supported on IDLE. Please enter your input. -----"

is a common problem faced by some testers.. due to their pc capability and python version environment

SO VS-CODE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WHILE DEBUGGING.
